# finance-visualizer

A program that takes a JSON configuration file containing names of files that holds finance data in CSV format taken directly from your bank(s). To be clear, this program does not connect to your banks or to the Internet at all for that matter. You need to manually download the finance data from your banks, put the paths to the finance files in the JSON configuration file, then run the program. The program will extract the finance data from the CSV files you give it, then standarize and consolidate the data.
